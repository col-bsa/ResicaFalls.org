											Resica Falls Scout Reservation is home to dozens of miles of trails to explore in the valley of Bushkill Creek and with Delaware State Forest to our North, it does not stop there. Come spend a weeking exploring our little patch of Pennsylvania wilderness. Additionally, we offer a number of orienteering courses as well as a geocache course. You can find those printouts on our <a href="important-documents">Important Documents page</a>.

										<p class="card-text">
											COPE is an acronym for Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience. It is comprised of a series of outdoor challenges, beginning with basic group initiative games, and progressing to more complicated low-course and high-course activities. Some of these events involve a group effort, while others test individual skills and agility. Participants climb, swing, balance, jump, rappel and think through solutions to a variety of challenges.
										</p>
										<p>
											The course provides an opportunity for each participant to achieve success as an individual and as a member of a group. The objectives of Project COPE include building confidence, developing leadership skills, and attaining a sense of common cooperation among group members. The course is designed to build more self-confidence in a shorter length of time than anything most people have experienced.
										</p>

											Currently we are offering programs on the following weekends
