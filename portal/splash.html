        <hr>

        <p>The Cradle of Liberty Council, BSA and Resica Falls recognize the need for its staff and guests to have access to the internet. Having access to this informational network requires responsible use consistent with the Boy Scouts of America's Social Media & Internet Safety Guidelines, plus state and federal laws. Scout leaders are advised to supervise their youth's Internet sessions.</p>

        <p>The Internet is a gateway to information of great diversity in many countries and cultures around the world. Use of the Internet, however, must be tempered with common sense and good judgment. Intentionally accessing information which is illegal, sexually explicit or offensive to certain racial, ethnic or religious groups is not permitted. The Cradle of Liberty Council, BSA is not responsible for material viewed or downloaded by users from the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide network of computers that contains millions of pages of information. Users are cautioned that many of these pages include offensive, sexually explicit, and inappropriate material. In general, it is difficult to avoid at least some contact with this material while using the Internet. The Cradle of Liberty and Resica Falls use software to identify inappropriate or sexually explicit Internet sites. Such sites may be blocked from access by company networks. In the event you nonetheless encounter inappropriate or sexually explicit material while browsing on the Internet, immediately disconnect from the site, regardless of whether the site was subject to company blocking software.</p>
