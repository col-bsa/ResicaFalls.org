						Thank you for taking the time to consider spending your summer working at Resica Falls Scout Reservation! Working on a campstaff is not only a fun way to spend your summer, but it is also a good way to make a difference in your life and the lives of each and every scout that passes through our program. As with most things there are many demands but the rewards can be far more meaningful as you will forge memories that can last a lifetime.
					</p>
					<p>
						All positions are paid so the application process is not trivial, but our administrative staff is well adept at finding the work that fits an applicant's skillset best. As long as you are willing to work hard, enjoy it, and embody the spirit of the Scout Oath and Law, you should strongly consider applying.
