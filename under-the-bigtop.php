					<p>The house lights are up and the circus is in town for the adventure that awaits with our 2020 theme, "Under the Big Top!" Your unit will be treated to a display of marvels during your stay at Resica Falls.</p>
					<h4>Program Highlights for 2020</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>As P.T. Barnum once said, "No one ever made a difference by being like everyone else." This summer at Resica Falls, weâ€™re rethinking how we do campwide program. Wander around the Big Springs Carnival on Monday evening, playing games, watching some performers, and snacking on your favorite carnival food.</li>
						<li>Lunch Clubs, Action Areas, and the weekly Scavenger Hunt are all to be reworked to meet the wants of our campers.</li>
						<li>Enjoy the classic Opening Campfire, build a creative troop gateway, and get your awesome costumes ready to bring the show alive!</li>
