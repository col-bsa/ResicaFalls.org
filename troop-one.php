						Is your troop going to camp a week you can't go with them?<br>
						Do you want to do COPE, High 5, Paddlerama, and earn a lot of merit badges?<br>
						Do you just want the week in camp to last a little longer even though your troop is leaving?
					</p>
					<p>
						If you answered yes to any of the above, then Troop One is for you!
					</p>
					<p>
						Troop One is a group of scouts that just wanted to spend a week in camp even though their troop wasn't there. Every week a new group of scouts comes together and forms a temporary troop led by their Scoutmaster and an assistant. These scout leaders are members of our staff that have had many years at Resica Falls and know how to make the most of what camp has to offer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Troop One is no different than any other week in camp except that if you are spending more than 1 week in camp (including any other camp), it is only half the normal price which can be found on our <a href="dates-and-rates">Dates and Rates</a> page.
					</p>

						To sign up, visit us at our <a href="dates-and-rates">Dates and Rates</a> page and find the week you want to spend a summer at Resica Falls!
