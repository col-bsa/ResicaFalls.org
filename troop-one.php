						Is your troop going to camp for a week and you can't go with them?<br>
						Do you want to do COPE, High 5, Paddlerama, and earn a lot of merit badges?<br>
						Do you just want the week in camp to last a little longer even though your troop is leaving?
					</p>
					<p>
						If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Troop One is for you!
					</p>
					<p>
						Troop One is a temporary troop, formed by scouts who are in camp when their troops are not. Members of our staff serve as the Scoutmaster and an assistant for Troop One. These scout leaders have years of experience at Resica Falls and know how to make the most of the facilities. Scouts in Troop One have the same experience as scouts with their regular troops, with more time in camp.
					</p>
					<p>
						Troop One scouts is perfect for any scout who wants to spend more than 1 week in camp, including stays in any other camp. Troop One is half the price of a week in camp with a scoutâ€™s troop.
