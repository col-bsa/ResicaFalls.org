						Situated in the beautiful Pocono Mountains, Resica Falls Scout Reservation is a 4200 acre Scouting Paradise. Set in an endless track of mountain trails, clear streams and waterfalls, Resica has an amazing program of activities for Scouts to enjoy during their summer camp experience. This paradise is the home to hundreds of different trees, plants and animals, and to over 3000 Scouts each summer.

						In 1957, the Valley Forge and Philadelphia Councils entered into a joint venture to develop this magnificent piece of land into a camp for Scouts to enjoy for generations to come. Although the Valley Forge Council would become the sole proprietor of the property in 1965, these same two councils would merge in 1996, creating the Cradle of Liberty Council. The Council would later enter into a land trust agreement, preserving the property forever as an undeveloped forest for scouting use. In 2017, Reisca Falls will celebrate its 60th summer season of Scout camping. Tens of thousands of Scouts have enjoyed an experience among the hidden natural treasures, creating memories that will last a lifetime.
