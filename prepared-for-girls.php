						A few of the ways we have been prepared for girls, and how we continue to work towards the future:
                        <ul>
							<li>Female British Scouts and Japanese Venturers, as well as local Sea Scout Ships and Venturing Crews have camped at Resica Falls.</li>
                            <li>Resica has hired an increasing number of female staff, in both junior staff and camp leadership positions.</li>
                            <li>Camp improvements that have been made in recent years are female friendly, particularly the 2015 Great Bend Showerhouse &ndash; an entire facility comprised of 10 individual showers/bathrooms.</li>
                            <li><strong>NEW for 2019!</strong> &ndash; An additional 7 new individual showers/bathrooms located at the Big Springs Pool to accommodate the needs of all our campers.</li>
                            <li>The camp leadership has developed a well-rounded, action-packed program designed to meet a variety of individual needs.</li>
                            <li>Check out our Leadersâ€™ Guide, and Program Guide to get an idea of the broad range of activities available at Resica Falls. The 2019 editions will be published in January &amp; February.</li>
