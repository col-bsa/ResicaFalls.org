						Resica Falls has partnered with FLIK Independent School Dining to provide Scouts and Scouters with a well-balanced and nutritious meal plan- approved by a certified nutritionist- for the duration of their stay in camp, beginning with dinner on Sunday. Each meal includes a hot entr&eacute;e with at least one side; lunch and dinner also include a vegetable. There is a fruit and yogurt bar available at breakfast, and a salad bar at both lunch and dinner, along with daily specialty salad bars at lunch. Peanut butter and jelly with multiple types of bread are also available at both lunch and dinner. Hot and cold drinks are available at twin juice bars located on either side of the dining hall.
