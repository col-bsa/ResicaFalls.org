						Resica Falls has partnered with FLIK Independent School Dining to provide Scouts and Scouters with a well-balanced and nutritious meal plan- approved by a certified nutritionist- for the duration of their stay in camp, beginning with dinner on Sunday. Each meal includes a hot entree with at least one side; lunch and dinner also include a vegetable. There is an available fruit and yogurt bar at breakfast and a salad bar at both lunch and dinner; there are also daily specialty salad bars available at lunch. Peanut butter and jelly with multiple types of bread are also available. Hot and cold drinks are available at twin juice bars on either side of the dining hall. A sample menu for this summer can be found here.

						Campers and adult leaders with dietary restrictions can note their individual restrictions with the campâ€™s FLIK food service manager before they come to camp. FLIK is more than happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions to ensure that campers and leaders have the best dining experience possible. For more information or to discuss dietary restrictions, please contact Marco Morales, FLIK regional manager, at <a href="mailto:MARCO.MORALES@COMPASS-USA.COM">marco.morales@compass-usa.com</a> Steve Mach, Assistant Camp Director, at <a href="mailto:acd@resicafalls.org">acd@resicafalls.org</a>.
