						National Youth Leadership Training is an exciting, action-packed program designed for councils to provide youth members with leadership skills and experience that they can use both in their home troops as well as other parts of their lives demanding leadership of self and others.  The NYLT course is centered around the concepts of what a leader must BE, what they must KNOW, and what they must DO. These key elements are taught with a clear focus on practical application.

						When teaching at Resica Falls Scout Reservation, the Cradle of Liberty Council NYLT Staff are able to make use of the resources that the well established regular summer camp program has to offer.  This can mean anything from an effortless meal in the dining hall so that more time can be spent on a special activity or presentation, to partaking in a camp wide program, or perhaps even a high adventure activity.
