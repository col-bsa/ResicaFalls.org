						Join us for a week-long trip of over 70 miles down the picturesque Delaware River. Paddlerama participants start out North of Big Springs and end the week at the Delaware Water Gap. Enjoy the natural wonder of the Delaware River. Camp along the river, run some rapids and share experiences with Scouts from other troops in this wet and wild experience. This is a great opportunity for Scouts that are looking for an exciting, outdoor experience and love the water!
					</p>
					<p>
						Begin your week at Resica Falls Scout Reservation where you will meet your guides for the week. With their help you will go over the trip’s itinerary, get a review and fit of the equipment you will use and get any skill refresher you may need. You will then review the safety procedures and effectively pack for your adventure.
					</p>
					<p>
						To Participate in Paddlerama you must be a registered Scout and at least 14 Years old at the time of participation.  You must also have a current BSA Annual Health &amp; Medical Record signed by a physician within the last 12 months. You must also be able to attain “Swimmer” during the swim test.
