						In the summer of 2016 Resica Falls premiered its newest and most exciting program area: the ATV course! Presented through a partnership between the Boy Scouts of America and Polaris Industries Inc., Scouts can spend a week learning the fundamentals of riding under the supervision of an ATV Safety Institute-certified instructor. For the 2020 season, we're changing how we offer our ATV program, and are offering two different experiences.
