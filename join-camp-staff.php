							<li>Acquire experiential education (learning by doing) and new skills that will last a lifetime</li>
							<li>Learn how to lead others and to apply leadership skills</li>
							<li>Be part of an effective team and cooperate with others to get things done</li>

					<p><strong>“I worked on staff for five Summers. When I went to college, it felt like I was living in a dorm full of babies. Most of them had never lived away from Mom, washed their own clothes or had a real job. Working on staff put me far ahead of the rest of the students.”</strong></p>
					<p><strong>“I’ve been in Scouting for a long time and have a lot of great memories. When I get together with my friends, the stories we tell and the friendships we talk about seem to revolve around our time on camp staff.”</strong></p>
