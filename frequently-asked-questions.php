										Resica Falls offers almost 70 different merit badges, including 13 eagle required badges. A complete list can be found on our <a href="programs-and-opportunities">Badges and Programs page</a>. It is important that you review all the requirements for each badge you intend on taking before coming to camp. You should also complete any necessary pre-requisite requirements before coming to camp. In many cases a signed note from a Scout leader is sufficient to show proof of completion of a pre-requisite.

										In addition to merit badges, Resica also offers various other activities, including our COPE and High Five programs.
