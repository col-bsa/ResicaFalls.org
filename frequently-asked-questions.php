									What you should bring to camp varies depending on which program you are participating in. A suggested packing list of things to bring can be found at in our Parents or Leaders Guides. Please consult with your unit leaders for specific guidelines and guidance on how to pack and what to bring (and not to bring) to camp.

										Resica Falls offers almost 70 different merit badges, including 13 eagle required badges. A complete list can be found on our <a href="programs-and-opportunities">Badges and Programs page</a>. It is important that you review all the requirements for each badge you intend on taking before coming to camp. You should also complete any necessary pre-requisite requirements before coming to camp. In many cases a signed note from a Scout leader is sufficient to show proof of completion of a pre-requisite.
									</p>
									<p>
										In addition to merit badges, Resica also offers various other activities, including our COPE and High Five programs.

									Of course! Resica Fall mantains a full trading post. The store stocks a wide variety of items you may want to purchase, including camping supplies, T-shirts and apparel, craft kits, merit badge pamphlets, books, snacks, drinks, and much more. In addition, some badges require the purchase of project kits to complete the badge. Please be sure you bring the appropriate spending money as to not feel left out. We recommend between $35 to $50 for the week.

									<p>
										A study performed by Harris Interactive, in conjunction with the Boy Scouts of America, shows that within the typical six days of Boy Scout summer camp, boys are "in an environment that comprehensively provides them with critical elements of healthy youth development."
									</p>
									<p>
										At camp, boys have time to consider and reflect on their place in life. Strong personal values and character are shaped as young boys are encouraged to take a part in decisions that impact others, contemplate their relationship with God, reflect on personal values, and participate in patriotic activities regarding American citizenship. Boys gain a positive sense of self-worth and usefulness through serving others. Scouts are productive and creative at camp.

										To ensure the safety of all campers, the Cradle of Liberty Council, BSA has enacted the following policy.
									</p>
									<p>
										Any Scout who leaves camp prior to the normal departure time on Saturday morning with their unit, will only be permitted to leave under the auspices of an adult approved by the parents of the Scout. A Camper Release Authorization form, signed by the parents of the Scout, must be on file in the Camp Office in these cases. This form will list all adults, who are authorized by the parents, with whom their son may leave camp. Scout leader should escort Scout to the Camp Office to sign out. An up to date version of the Camper Release Authorization form can be found on our <a href="important-documents">Important Documents</a> page.

										Yes. Please fill out the Drug Administration Record. Send that and the medications with your son to camp. Each troop handles their medication process a little differently. Some collect all the forms and medications before going to camp. Contact your troop leader for the exact details.

									<p>
										While at camp, if the medication is needed during an emergency such as an asthma attack or allergic reaction, the camper may keep the medication on themselves. If it is only needed at planned occasions such as every morning or every evening, your unit leaders or our health lodge staff will keep it and dispense it as you describe in accordance with the prescription.

									While we cannot keep a Scout from having a phone in camp, it is highly discouraged you send your son with one. Scouts with cellphones are less likely to take full advantage of our multifaceted program and are at a greater risk of becoming homesick. <strong>Resica Falls is not responsible for the loss or damage of any personal devices.</strong>
