                    <p>A new program for 2019, Bring S’more Scouts looks to entice more of the Scouts in your unit to come to summer camp. If you bring 80% of the registered Scouts in your unit to camp, we'll supply you with all the s'more fixings for a fun night around the campfire in your campsite.</p>
                    <p>But wait, there’s more &mdash; not only will your unit earn your achievement with s’mores, but you’ll have the opportunity to be joined by one of your favorite staff members. Bring 90% of your registered Scouts to camp, and receive an exclusive Resica Falls S'mores Club patch before your unit arrives.</p>
                    <p><a href="schedule-a-visit">Sign up today for a camp promotion</a>, and we’ll help you get to 80% and beyond!</p>
